# 30-Rock-Data
A small project on R based on 30 Rock data extracted from Wikipedia and IMDB. The purpose was just to see if there was a pattern in viewership and IMDB ratings throughout the entire series. Showcases some of my abilities when it comes to web scraping, using R packages like ggplot, and visualization.
